## R Programming - Programming Assignment 2
## These functions will cache the result of a matrix and solve the inverse of the said matrix.

## This function will accept a matrix object and cache the inverse of it for future use

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function will compute the inverse of a given matrix returned by "makecacheMatrix" above.
## If the inverse has not been solved then it stores it in a cache for future and faster retrieval

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
